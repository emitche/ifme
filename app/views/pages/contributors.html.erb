			Being open and honest about my journey with obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and depression helps me to accept myself and reach out for support. My hope is to encourage others to feel more comfortable about sharing their experiences. I created if me as a way to tackle the problem of doing so in daily life.

			I am contributing to if me because one's mental health is often disregarded. It is important that everybody watches and observes how they are feeling on a daily basis, and it is also important that we look out for each other.

			As a health science student I have been exposed medical literature that focuses on neuroplasticity, the idea that our environment and actions can change neural circuitry and pathways, and its role in shaping mental health disorders. For example, studies shows the in people with OCD, there is hyperconnectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and the caudate nucleus, structures of the brain that are responsible for decision-making and thinking. Thus novel treatment of OCD focuses on targeting these principles and beliefs these obsessions and compulsions are founded on in order to rewire the brain. I believe if me provides a platform to habitually reflect and help manage one’s wellbeing in addition to formal medical treatment.

			if me is important to me because I see the need for it to exist, because it aims to build support networks for its users and help them grow as individuals and externally be truthful to themselves about what they need to do and when they need to do it, as well as be able to reach out and get advice on how to do things better and can choose to be completely anonymous in the process if they so choose to be. And what makes it even more distinctive is its target audience – because with the stigmas surrounding mental health and various other things, it is very difficult for individuals with mental health concerns to find the right kind of support, because only the individual can determine if something is actually benefitting them. if me allows you to build your own support system and change it as you please which I find very unique, and something everyone should at least give a try, regardless of whether or not  you currently have mental health concerns. I enjoy learning and helping make a meaningful impact, and contributing to if me helps me do that.

			People can struggle with their minds despite everything being “right” in their lives. People’s minds can also give them remarkable resilience through serious adversity. I have been studying for years, in fields from biology to philosophy, to understand this and make a contribution. The internet needs a comprehensive, community-based mental health resource and if me has the kind of people behind it to make it happen.

			Our minds are the very screens behind which we perceive the world, yet there is not enough discourse on the importance of sanity. <i>if me</i> is the community I wish existed during my dark times, and I'm hoping to help someone through theirs by contributing to this project.

			Our well-being is important. This includes our mental and emotional health in addition to our physical health. There's a stigma around discussing mental health, but there should not be. Our mental health is an important part of our well-being as human beings.
